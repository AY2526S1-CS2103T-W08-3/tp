### Project: EduLink

Private tutors waste time juggling spreadsheets, chats, and notes to manage students and parents. 
A typing-first address book for private tutors lets them pull up student/parent details instantly, 
group contacts by level/subject/class, and keep brief lesson/fee notes.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Filter students by lesson.
    * What it does: Allows the user filter and view a list of students who are enrolled in a specific lesson.
    * Justification: This feature greatly improves usability by helping tutors quickly identify which students are 
      linked to a particular lesson. When managing multiple students and schedules, it is easy to forget or mix up 
      who attends which session. By providing an instant filtered view, the user can verify lesson groups, 
      correct mistakes, and make informed scheduling or preparation decisions efficiently.
   
* **New Feature**: Filter lessons by student.
    * What it does: Allows the user to filter and view all lessons that a specific student is enrolled in.
    * Justification: This feature provides tutors with a clear view of a studentâ€™s commitments across the timetable,
      supporting personalized planning and preventing scheduling conflicts. 
      When tutors teach many students, knowing a student's full lesson load at a glance helps with preparation, 
      rescheduling, and workload balancing.
