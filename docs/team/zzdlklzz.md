### Project: EduLink

Private tutors waste time juggling spreadsheets, chats, and notes to manage students and parents. A typing-first address book for private tutors lets them pull up student/parent details instantly, group contacts by level/subject/class, and keep brief lesson/fee notes.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to undo/redo previous commands.
    * What it does: allows the user to undo all previous commands one at a time. Preceding undo commands can be reversed by using the redo command.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.
    * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
    * Credits: *{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}*

* **New Feature**: Added a history command that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link]()

* **Project management**:
    * Managed releases `v1.3` - `v1.5rc` (3 releases) on GitHub

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
    * Updated the GUI color scheme (Pull requests [\#33](), [\#34]())
    * Wrote additional tests for existing features to increase coverage from 88% to 92% (Pull requests [\#36](), [\#38]())

* **Documentation**:
    * Developer Guide:
        * Added use cases for MVP specification (Pull request [\#38]())

* **Community**:
    * PRs reviewed (with non-trivial review comments): [\#12](), [\#32](), [\#19](), [\#42]()
    * Contributed to forum discussions (examples: [1](), [2](), [3](), [4]())
    * Reported bugs and suggestions for other teams in the class (examples: [1](), [2](), [3]())
    * Some parts of the history feature I added was adopted by several other class mates ([1](), [2]())

* **Tools**:
    * Filler
