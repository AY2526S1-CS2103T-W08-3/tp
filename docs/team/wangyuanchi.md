### Project: EduLink

Private tutors waste time juggling spreadsheets, chats, and notes to manage students and parents. A typing-first address book for private tutors lets them pull up student/parent details instantly, group contacts by level/subject/class, and keep brief lesson/fee notes.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Filler feature.
    * What it does: allows the user to undo all previous commands one at a time. Preceding undo commands can be reversed by using the redo command.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.
    * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
    * Credits: *{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}*
